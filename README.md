# Naughts-and-Crosses
In this project I have applied my knowledge of DirectX 11 and object orientation in C++ into remaking the popular game Naughts and Crosses. I've used my own code in the following files: Game.h, Game.cpp, Controller.h, Controller.cpp, Entities.h, Entities.cpp and parts of the main.cpp file (mainly player inputs and for creating the geometry buffers for a cube)
